			 <p>I got a notification this morning that my application to join the <a href="https://literal.club/pages/librarian">Literal Librarian</a> program was approved.</p>

<p><a href="https://literal.club/">Literal</a> is one of numerous Goodreads alternatives that have launched in the past several years. I&rsquo;ve been using it since May 2021 (in beta). I also use the Bookshelves feature in Micro.blog with the Epilogue app for iOS to track my reading. Micro.blog automatically posts to my Mastodon account, so I guess I use that too.</p>

<p>The CMS powering Literal&rsquo;s book data is quite snappy, and I&rsquo;ve managed to upload a couple covers and add page count to a few editions already. The message that greets you in the CMS dashboard is &ldquo;Use your powers wisely, and enjoy!&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780771049835">The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity</a> by David Graeber and David Wengrow 📚</p>

<p>This book is worth reading, as are the critiques of it, especially the <a href="https://climateandcapitalism.com/2021/12/17/the-dawn-of-everything-gets-human-history-wrong/">responses by Chris Knight, Nancy Lindisfarne, and Jonathan Neale</a>. I would not waste your time with any reviews penned by employees of the American Enterprise Institute.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I finished this book and found it worth engaging with. Graeber and Wengrow present a much more hopeful view of humanity than the other popular titles in the Big Histories genre they are in argument with, including &ldquo;Sapiens&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guns, Germs and Steel&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Very few people realize that the composition ‘Shchedryk’ was composed and performed during a time when there was intense political struggle and social upheaval in Ukraine&hellip;The same choir director who commissioned the song formed the Ukrainian National Chorus, mandated by a fledgling Ukrainian government, in 1919 to promote Ukranian music in major cultural centers in the West. Touring across Europe and North and South America, the chorus performed over 1,000 concerts.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;The authors explore why and how to create accessible data content, discussing issues such as how organizations can incorporate accessibility throughout their process, how to write effective alternative (alt) text, and how to implement accessible content onto the web.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m at a new organization, and we publish a lot of data. In my role as a UI designer, I may be asked to help with data visualization in 2023. Hoping this timely guidance can help us shape our data practice and accessibility practice. One theme in particular sticks out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Accessibility should not be a specialty.</strong> Anyone working with data or creating digital content should understand and strive to produce accessible products. Although some of the aspects of creating accessible online content clearly require technical experience, the work should not be left to a single person or some subset of the team.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Today is Giving Tuesday, a global holiday for charitable giving initiated ten years ago. These days I try to support smaller, <strong>local</strong> organizations aiding and mobilizing poor and working people.</p>

<p>On my blog this morning <a href="https://nicksimson.com/posts/2022-giving-tuesday/">I highlighted some orgs</a> that touch the lives of people in places I&rsquo;ve called home: Upstate NY, Arizona, and Tennessee.</p>

<p>I also highlighted the <a href="https://www.chicagofreedomschool.org/about">Chicago Freedom School</a>, and the <a href="https://djdinstitute.org/">Debs-Jones-Douglass Institute</a>, two orgs I believe are keeping Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s dream and legacy alive today.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you what to do with your money, but I encourage to find out who is helping and organizing in your communities and fund them. I hope you&rsquo;ll be radical and generous this holiday season.</p>

<p>Prototyping with code is my favorite way to build prototypes whenever I want to work with the real material of the Web and sketch out an idea in the browser with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Maybe it’s a layout that uses CSS Grid, a GSAP animation test, or a little interactive component. Whatever it is, I try to focus on the essence of what I want to try out and learn. What I don’t focus on, however, is code quality. And this is where it can get complicated.</p>

<p>On every possible level, this is an extraordinary body of work: moving, illuminating, troubling, above all humane. Mr. Lee did not frame his photographs to appall, although any minimally empathetic person will be appalled by the conditions they often capture. He framed them in a way that most often features, within the surroundings of brutal poverty, human beings whose expression, gesture or stance insists on their own profound dignity. On a self that is irreducible and irreplaceable.</p>

			 <p>Mandy Brown: <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/no-one-is-non-technical">No one is “non-technical”</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we talk about the makeup of our teams, there’s often an impulse to break people down into “technical” and “non-technical” roles, as code for “engineers” and “everyone else.” The latter comes up often when discussing internal tools or systems, which by definition have to be accessible to those “non-technical” folks. Sometimes the language bleeds out to refer to users of a product, especially if the product has both a developer-facing experience and orientations for other kinds of users. I’ve even used the “non-technical” language myself, bemoaning the lack of a better alternative. But that right there should have been a tell: there’s no suitable synonym because the concept is a fiction. There’s no such thing as a “non-technical” role; there are only different techniques.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a certain point when turns of phrase are so out of fashion they become fresh again. Orwell’s dying metaphors of the 1940s were <em>take up the cudgel for</em> and <em>ring the changes on</em>, which would feel interesting now. Ours are <em>full-throated</em> and <em>deep dive</em> and <em>unpack</em> and <em>dig in</em> and <em>at the end of the day</em>.</p>

<p>I also picked up a new pop-linguistic phrase from this article: “semantic bleaching.”</p>

<p>An interview with architects and designers LeeAnn Suen and Florian Idenburg on their new book about office design.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Architecture has a very interesting relationship with, say, reality; maybe with capitalism. The architect wants to position themself as a critical person who tries to — or claims to — work for the people, against the system. So office work is very rarely celebrated, because it’s considered participating within the system, rather than taking a critical distance or sort of an opposition to that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This episode was unplanned, but when Barbara Ehrenreich died on September 1, 2022, we felt an urge to honor her memory and the profound influence she has had on the American left, socialism, feminism, and our collective thinking about class struggle. From her work in the women&rsquo;s health movement of the 1960s, to her theorizing (with  ex-husband John Ehrenreich) of the &ldquo;professional-managerial class&rdquo; in the 1970s, to her explorations of Reagan-era yuppie pathologies, and her renowned exposé of low-wage work in 2001&rsquo;s <em>Nickel and Dimed</em>, Barbara Ehrenreich has been an essential and nuanced guide to the inner-life of American class conflict in the latter half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s been nearly 20 years since I read <em>Nickel and Dimed</em>, assigned to all incoming freshmen at my college. I have since read some of Ehrenreich&rsquo;s other 21st century books, in particular I remember <em>Bait and Switch</em> and <em>Bright-Sided</em> being quite good.</p>

<p>Rest in Peace.</p>

			 <p>Video: <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=LzN6ls_pzvo">Dinosaurs, the Sitcom Before Time</a> 📺</p>

<p>I remember watching this series as a little kid (we were an ABC TGIF household) in the early 1990s, but I don’t remember this having such a Point of View.</p>

<p>Behind the animatronics and full body puppets brought to life by the Jim Henson Company were messages about religion, capitalism, feminism, social control, colonialism, and the environment.</p>

<p>There was an episode that mirrored the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas hearings, which were going on at the time. A bunch of the surnames in the show were actual fossil fuel companies, and the company the main character worked for had a logo reminiscent of the Dupont corporation. Spoilert alert: Environmental destruction and actions taken by Earl’s employer bring about a mass extinction event at the very end of the series.</p>

<p>Looking at it now, I’m a bit surprised that this was something my Reagan and Bush supporting parents (my dad was also a Rush Limbaugh listener) allowed us to watch, watched with us, and bought toys based on. But they were also fans of All in the Family, which along with The Flintstones, was an inspiration behind this show.</p>

<p>Kevin Clash, the performer behind the Baby Sinclair puppet, was also the puppeteer and voice of Sesame Street’s Elmo, and Jessica Walter, who voiced the mother, would later portray Lucille Bluth on Arrested Development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since design systems happen whether we want them to or not, our task is not to decide whether or not we need one. We need to decide if we’re better served by being intentional about our design system decisions or letting the design system drift to see what emerges from real-world use.</p>

<p>Most design systems fall somewhere in between intentional and emergent. The sweet spot for creating a design system isn’t to choose one approach or the other, but rather to develop the ability to blend the two approaches effectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Jason&rsquo;s three-part series from 2020 is pretty helpful if you are &ldquo;just getting started&rdquo; with design systems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a hard time in my life. I felt tired, undervalued, and anxious about my visibility in the company. Oddly enough, though, the experience of becoming a mother made me a better designer. I share this because I&rsquo;ve seen others express concern that becoming a parent will negatively affect their career. Certainly, there are examples of toxic companies that only want to hire 20-somethings with no children or worldly commitments (though why anyone would fund leadership with such short-sighted expectations is beyond me). Parenthood teaches you ways of thinking about, reacting to, and experiencing life that you can never understand until you&rsquo;re in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Included: Redefining Accessibility for the World Wide Web open-standards web expert author and presenter Molly E. Holszschlag shows non-technical and technical readers alike that building websites to be inclusive and accessible is good for business, growth, and for people everywhere. She starts by explaining what it means to have a web that is accessible to everyone of all abilities, anywhere globally, and even accessible to anything human and machine. She then tackles how different sensory perceptions can be used to ease human computer interaction. For organizations she outlines the processes, workflows, expertise, and testing needed to deliver on organization goals for inclusive access. And she does all this with a minimum of code, showing the web designer that yes, coding for inclusion is built in to web principles rather than something added on later and showing managers and leaders how their organization will benefit from this inclusive web design.</p>

<p>Over on my macro blog last week <a href="https://nicksimson.com/posts/2022-these-webfonts-do-not-track-you/">I wrote about switching from Google Fonts to self-hosting my webfonts</a>. Self-hosting variable fonts is not that difficult, but finding the variable font files from Google can be tricky.</p>

<p>If you are interested in switching from variable fonts on Google&rsquo;s CDN to self-hosting, Fontshare is worth looking into. They don&rsquo;t have every Google variable font, but many of the better-designed ones. My current choices, <a href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/literata">Literata</a> and <a href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/epilogue">Epilogue</a> are both on Fontshare.</p>

<p>In addition to many open source designs, ITF offer their own &ldquo;closed source&rdquo; designs, which are still free to download and use, even for commercial projects. I&rsquo;m particularly drawn to <a href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi">Satoshi</a>, <a href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/zodiak">Zodiak</a>, and <a href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/general-sans">General Sans</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Just so we’re clear: providing a link to a LinkedIn video is not hybrid management training. Same goes for an optional webinar. Hybrid management is a difficult, complex skill, and company’s refusal to acknowledgment as much is a primary source of current office dysfunction and dissatisfaction. The half-assed approach to hybrid work is similar, in many ways, to the overarching failure of organizational DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) efforts: someone decided it would be a good thing for the organization to pursue, but then put no resources or organizational energy towards actually making it happen. The organization has a policy but no actual practice. </blockquote>

<p>I bookmarked this to watch a while ago and I’m glad I took the time to watch it. This is a replay of a live Twitch stream hosted by Alex Trost, with Mike Aparicio sharing many lessons he’s learned from building design systems. As a demo, Mike did a CSS refactor and built a fledgling design system based on the <a href="https://frontend.horse">frontend.horse</a> home page, walking through the steps he took to get there. If you’re new to building design systems, I think this is a fantastic introduction.</p>

<p>This video clocks in at 2 hours, 45 minutes (I watched at 1.25 speed). I typically do not consume my web design/development knowledge this way—give me a 45 minute talk or 15 minute technical article, please!</p>

<p>Thankfully, there’s a ton of useful information here, and I took notes. The project comes with <a href="https://fh-tack.netlify.app/">extensive documentation</a> with all the links and a <a href="https://github.com/peruvianidol/frontend-horse">GitHub repo</a> you can comb through. Really appreciate the time and care Alex and Mike put into this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Looking back at how Watergate progressed, it remains unclear how much we can attribute Nixon’s undoing to the Constitution working or how much owes to lucky breaks and the unique collection of personalities involved. Even if the rule of law ultimately prevailed in Watergate, it has become more difficult to contest presidential power since. Paradoxically, in the process of dealing with President Nixon, the institutions involved—Congress, the Supreme Court, and the special prosecutor—set precedents that made it harder to check a runaway presidency.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this book, particularly the chapter on Cash’s prison concerts and about his opposition to the death penalty and activism for prison reform. The epilogue, on the American recordings (produced by Rick Rubin) and the end of Cash’s life around the beginning of the Iraq war, was also quite good.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781501308734">Freedom of Choice</a> by Evie Nagy 📚</p>

<p>This is (I’m pretty sure) the only authorized book about the band DEVO (or Devo), published by Bloomsbury in the 33 and 1/3 series, 35 years after the album Freedom of Choice came out.</p>

<p>The thesis of this book, backed up by interviews with members of DEVO, is that the recording of Freedom of Choice represented the creative and collaborative pinnacle of the band. The album’s success spelled the beginning of the end though, which is also ironic since they released six LPs after this one, never officially broke up, and are still touring today.</p>

<p>The book is a solid history of the band, the album and a meditation on what it means to be a Devotee.</p>

			 <p>I spent a little time this weekend adding an <a href="https://nicksimson.com/accessibility/">accessibility statement</a> to my personal website. This is important to me for a few reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tried to make all the features and content on my site as accessible as I know how to do. I want my users to know I care about them.</p></li>

<li><p>I want people who work with me to understand the importance of digital accessibility and my commitment to ongoing learning and social responsibility.</p></li>

<li><p>If there are errors or accessibility issues on my site, I need to know about them so I can go about fixing them as quickly as possible.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s far more common to see accessibility statements where they may be legally required, such as large corporations, governments, and education websites. I have noticed a few people I look up to include statements on their sites, and I&rsquo;ve linked to them on my own page.</p>

			 <p>Andy Bell: <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/the-tech-tool-carousel/">The tech tool carousel</a></p>

<p>I can relate to Andy’s feelings here. I am not always on the lookout for the latest front end tooling. Tools are just a means to an end. I get a bit anxious when I see projects that have more than two third-party dependencies or libraries. Especially when I’m unfamiliar with those packages or what they do.</p>

<p>For me, the best tools do one thing very well and stay out of my way while I’m working on a design. My longtime favorites are Markdown, Sass, and Gulp.</p>

<p>It was important for me to understand what every line of code does on my website when I embarked on a personal site redesign. I switched my website from Jekyll to Eleventy a couple years ago. It was a nice upgrade and (most importantly) I didn’t have to relearn everything I knew about making a website.</p>

<p>Unlike Andy, I do enjoy writing code. I love the challenge of designing something I have to translate into HTML CSS and JavaScript myself. The key for me is writing less code, not more. My least favorite part of the job is  updating dependencies or (worse) debugging someone else‘s code, especially if it is not well documented.</p>

			 <p>In 2007, when I was still a design student, I signed up to get Emigre’s font catalogues sent in the mail. This was before Adobe Fonts, or more accurately, when Adobe Fonts were only type families designed by Adobe and packaged in a CD-ROM that cost a couple hundred dollars.</p>

<p>15 years and eight address changes later, it’s still a delight to get these little Emigre booklets in my mailbox.</p>

<p>This catalog is a supplement to a series of publications featuring pictures of California. It contains statistics and background information from a selection of 479 pictures taken between 2006 and 2021. Displaying this kind of data presents a unique typographic challenge, and offers a perfect scenario to exhibit our fonts in action. So this booklet functions as a type catalog as well.</p>

			 <p>Jamelle Bouie: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/06/opinion/supreme-court-roe-dobbs-legitimacy.html">Why Republicans Are So Angry About the Supreme Court Leak</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When McConnell led the Senate Republican caucus in a blockade of President Barack Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court in 2016 and then killed what remained of the judicial filibuster the next year to place Neil Gorsuch in the seat instead, they diminished the legitimacy of the court. When those same Republicans looked past a credible accusation of sexual assault to confirm Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, they again diminished the legitimacy of the court. And when, with weeks left before the 2020 presidential election, Republicans ignored their own rule from four years earlier — that an election-year vacancy “should not be filled until we have a new president” — to place Amy Coney Barrett on the bench in a rushed, slapdash process, they once more diminished the legitimacy of the court.</p>

<p>What’s more, their occasional protests notwithstanding (in a speech last year at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville, Barrett insisted the court was “not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks”), the court’s conservatives have done almost nothing to dispel the view that their majority is little more than the judicial arm of the Republican Party. They use “emergency” orders to issue sweeping rulings in favor of ideologically aligned groups; they invent new doctrines designed to undermine voting rights protections; and as we’ve just witnessed, they’ll let nothing, not even 50 years of precedent, stand in the way of a sweeping ideological victory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to make the most usable user experience. And so the way to do that, the secret sauce, is to give the device as much information as possible, to be as expressive as possible about our intent, so that the device has all the information it needs to be able to create the most usable user experience. And that is what semantics is for&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;I believe personally, that expressiveness beats out any other mantra about code cleanliness or anything like that. And writing expressive code has never led me astray.</p>

<p>I left the sewing machine for someone else to take home.</p>

<p><p>This one really pissed me off. Three pretty ordinary people (a prop artist, a molecular biology professor and a physician) had their names, images and likenesses swiped in the service of COVID-19 conspiracy claims. Three ordinary people just using the internet to conduct and publish their research, to entertain, or to connect with others. </p>

<p><p>After my wife and I had a miscarriage earlier this year, Dr. Rockwell&rsquo;s story in particular makes me pretty furious. People post publicly about their vaccination statuses in an effort to encourage others to get the jab. People post publicly about their pregnancy loss in an effort to de-stigmatize something that <a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/early-pregnancy-loss">a lot of people go through</a>, but not a lot of people feel comfortable talking about. Dr. Rockwell could very easily be any number of women we know.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I get disgusted knowing that some anonymous people are making money by deceiving others. They are also leading people to an early, preventable death or infecting others during a global pandemic. Furthermore, this behavior gets rewarded by social media companies in the form of likes, shares and other engagement metrics.</p>

<p>Not sure if it was all the 20th anniversary coverage of Sept. 11, but I felt like watching the 2004 documentary <em>I Like Killing Flies</em> this week. The film is about famed NYC cook Kenny Shopsin and his idiosyncratic family-run restaurant Shopsin's General Store. The film is not so much about the trauma of 9/11 in Lower Manhattan but the casualties of the real estate trends that change a neighborhood's character. In this case, the gentrification of Greenwich Village in the late 1990s/early 2000s.</p>

<p>Eve Shopsin passed away during the making of the documentary, and Kenny died in 2018, but <a href="https://www.shopsins.com/">the restaurant is still around</a>, run by some of the kids at the Essex Market on the Lower East Side. Covid can't keep the Shopsin clan down, and their website says they are doing take-out and delivery (something you could not get in the 2002/3 incarnation of Shopsin's) to stay open.</p>

<p>I went in the Essex Market in 2014 trying to find the place, but I must have walked past the booth--I read it was tiny. There are a ton of vendors and its easy to get lost in the place. Not sure if I was secretly hoping to get kicked out by the famously cantankerous waitstaff or secretly relieved I saved myself the embarrassment of trying to fit in.</p>

<p>Not being in New York and able to eat at the place today, I could read daughter Tamara Shopsin's graphic memoir, <em><a href="https://www.tamarashopsin.com/asgfaq/#/">Arbitrary Stupid Goal</a></em>. It's about growing up in a larger than life family and the disappearing way of life of her 1970s/80s West Village childhood. Or I can pick up <a href="https://tastecooking.com/the-zen-of-ken/"><em>Eat Me: The Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin</em></a>, a cookbook that famously advises you not to follow the recipes too closely.</p>

<p>Essential reading, however, is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/15/dont-mention-it">Calvin Trillin's 2002 <em>New Yorker</em> profile</a> of Kenny and Eve and Shopsin's General Store.</p>

<p>Bonus video: Kenny Shopsin shows Conan O&rsquo;Brien how to make pancakes in 2008:

<p>I&rsquo;m still hoping to convince my parents to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but these conversations are getting more and more frustrating. It is becoming apparent that we inhabit two different realities.</p>

<p>Facebook and the Telegram app are (still) particle accelerators of dangerous misinformation, and this weekend I heard elements of every conspiracy theory under the sun. It&rsquo;s tempting to write off the 30% of the country that believes the 2020 election results were fradulent or stolen. It&rsquo;s hard when that number includes members of your own family.</p>

<p>I reverse image search attachments in my email and use <a href="https://snopes.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://snopes.com/">snopes.com</a> to search key terms I hear from these phone conversations. Not necessarily to fact-check my family into changing their minds&hellip;that is unlikely to work. Tonight I re-read &ldquo;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds">Why Facts Don&rsquo;t Change Our Minds</a>&rdquo;, by Elizabeth Kolbert. It&rsquo;s a review (published in 2017) of three books about confirmation bias and the possible evolutionary purpose of reason.</p>

<p>Instead, the fact-checking and debunking activities help me understand where some of these outlandish claims are coming from, and possibly <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/09/the-big-money-behind-the-big-lie">the money behind them</a>. At this point I don&rsquo;t want to argue about whether the moon landing was faked or if John F. Kennedy Jr. is still alive. I don&rsquo;t want to see someone I love willingly fall prey to a <a href="https://www.logically.ai/articles/nesara-and-the-business-of-false-hope">financial scam</a>. I don&rsquo;t want them to die from or infect others with the coronavirus.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m sharing this <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychoanalysis-unplugged/202103/when-youve-lost-someone-qanon">Psychology Today article</a> if it helps anyone else with some rudimentary steps to being there for a loved one if/when they&rsquo;re ready to come back to reality.</p>

And amazingly the dot com was available! <a href="https://siteleaf.com">Siteleaf</a> is a great experience for editing markdown files. Pretty great way to host a site inexpensively with a good CMS without compromising quality or performance. I still love how easy it is to work with collections in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. This is also the first site I launched supporting light mode and dark mode.</p>

			 <p>An introduction: My name is Nick, short for Nicholas, which means <em>"victory of the people"</em>. I currently live in Knoxville, Tenn. and work full time as a web designer at a public university. </p>

<p>This new site will serve as an extension of my <a href="https://nicksimson.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nicksimson.com">personal site</a>. The content will be a bit less polished than the writing contained on my main site. I hope to publish more frequently here, exploring my interests and taking notes in short bursts. Expect to see more seeds of ideas and half-formed thoughts. It may also get a little extra <a href="https://log.nicksimson.com/categories/personal/" data-type="URL">personal</a> here.</p>

<p>I also hope to use more <a href="https://indieweb.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> features and technologies on this <strike>WordPress-powered</strike> site, which are a bit technically harder to get up and running on static sites (the main nicksimson.com is powered by <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>). </p>

<p><h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>I came across the term <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history" data-type="URL" data-id="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital garden</a> in December 2020 as I was starting to redesign my personal site. In late summer 2021 I came across the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplace books</a>, through the personal websites of <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/">Piper Haywood</a> and <a href="https://boffosocko.com/">Chris Aldrich</a>. I don&rsquo;t know what shape this site will ultimately take, so I&rsquo;m going to just call it a <strong>log</strong> for now.</p>

<p>I also discovered the <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">Homebrew Website Club</a> in the summer of 2021 and found a small, but passionate group of writers, designers and technologists meeting each week to talk about...websites (a favorite topic of mine).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://nicksimson.com/posts/2021-commonplace-books/">I wrote a little about these discoveries</a> and what excites me about these personal sites that are a bit more nonlinear than the standard blog.</p>

<h2>Going forward</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm not sure how long I want to maintain two different blogs. Maybe I'll eventually fold my writing archive from 2014 to now into this site? It's only 25 posts so far, so a relatively simple migration. Or maybe this log informs the writing on the main site. The hyperlink is a powerful feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<p>I am less and less active on social media platforms Twitter and Instagram. The <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo">silos</a> I tend to favor are Are.na, Reading.am<strike>, and Goodreads</strike>. Maybe this log can act as a bridge between those silos (visuals, ideas, web content, book-tracking) and what gets output on nicksimson.com or into the work I do for my clients.</p>

<p>I definitely want to customize the look of this site a little more. <strike>Right now I'm using Matthias Pfefferle's <a href="https://notiz.blog/projects/autonomie/">Autonomie theme</a>, as it is built to support several kinds of post formats and work with IndieWeb plugins. It's a beautiful theme, I just want to make it a little more of my own. I'm hoping that tending a WordPress site of my own improves the work I do for my clients using this platform.</strike></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Here I&rsquo;ll just put a little note to self to come back in six months, and then a year to evaluate how things are going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>The last thing to keep in mind is that I am keeping this log primarily for my own benefit, but posting it publicly in the chance that it helps others. I like this quote by Piper Haywood that surfaced from the commonplace books wiki entry and the September 1st Homebrew meetup:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:quote -->

<p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The best personal blogs I’ve come across feel like a glimpse in to someone’s personal notebook, something filled mostly with notes written with the author in mind first and foremost vs notes that have been written with a wider audience in mind. A good personal blog can (and maybe should) contain a mixture of both, since they both can be absolutely great and useful. But when it is only ever writing for an audience… well that doesn’t feel like a personal blog, to me.</p><cite>Piper Haywood, <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/rietveld-brigham-didion/">April 22, 2021 entry</a></cite></blockquote>
